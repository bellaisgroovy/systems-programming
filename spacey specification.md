#spacey #concurrency 

You must:
- Summarise the concurrency and synchronisation means of three programming languages
- summarise the languagesâ€™ memory management techniques
- choose a language that would be best for the project scenario
- justify your choice of language in the context of the scenario

I will write in a "neutral academic tone".

The scenario is a team developing software for a solar energy satellite that needs to run thousands of processes concurrently for it's many sensors, and have capacity to run more processes in the future.

The team is already proficient in C, C++, Java, Python, and Golang.
