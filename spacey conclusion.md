Python is too slow because it is both high level, and not compiled. It is a big investment to put hardware in space so it does not make sense not to invest proportional resources in developing more efficient code. Also with such precise, time sensitive, corrections as the satellite needs to make, efficient, fast code is a must. This is just not a specialty of python

Writing in C will require greater resources in structuring the program with an architecture that can scale since it is a procedural language.

Writing in Java will incur performance costs compared to C due to the overhead of the JVM.

Writing the program in Java will take less time as it is higher level and easier to deal with.

despite the longer development time, I think that given the emphasis on performance needed by the satellite, C is the best of the three options.
