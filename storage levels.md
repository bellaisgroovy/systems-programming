# questions

- what is the storage/memory hierarchy?
- what is caching?

# recall

- the memory hierarchy refers to memory being more expensive and scarcer as it becomes faster, so most computers have many levels of storage
- caching is saving values that are predicted to be needed soon in faster storage so they are faster to access

# notes

- in most computers, there is a hierarchy of storage
	- fast, scarce, and volatile
	- slow, plentiful, and durable
	- layers
		- main memory
		- cache
		- registers
- caching
	- temporarily holding data from slow storage in fast storage for quick access
	- aim to store data that will be needed most commonly
		- eg if program requested a thing, hold the things next to it since its likely they will be needed too
