# Language options

I should pick languages I know stuff about already so its faster to write. I should pick multithreaded languages because of the massive speed up it would offer. I should pick efficient languages because it is running in space so hardware is very commodity.

I think I will do C/C++, Java, and Ada. C/C++ and Java because the team (and I) am familiar with them, they are reasonably efficient, and they allow multithreaded concurrency. Ada because its what many actual satellites use, it will be interesting to write about, and it isn't Python which is the only other real option I know. Python is unsuitable because it is very inefficient.
