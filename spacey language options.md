# Language options

I should pick languages I know stuff about already so its faster to write. I should pick multithreaded languages because of the massive speed up it would offer. I should pick efficient languages because it is running in space so hardware is very commodity.

I think I will do C/C++, Java, and Python. C/C++ and Java because the team (and I) am familiar with them, they are reasonably efficient, and they allow multithreaded concurrency. I will compare python because I sort of know it and it will highlight the other language's benefits
