#C #part-1 
- function pointers
	- pointer to the code of a function
	- to pass start point of a function to another function so it can run it
- using the heap (with functions from `<stdlib.h>)
	- malloc
		- `void *malloc(size_t size);`
			- returns pointer to memory allocated or NULL if it doesn't allocate
		- `void free (void *ptr)`
			- frees memory block starting at ptr
			- set ptr to null after freeing to make it easy to check if it has been freed
- challenges
	- dangling pointers
		- pointers to locations that are already free
		- good practice to set to null after freeing
		- use can lead to segmentation faults
	- double frees
		- calling free on a pointer twice - even a copy of that pointer
	- memory leaks
		- losing pointers to allocated memory
			- now you cant free it!
