In C, the memory is split into the heap and the stack. 

**Heap**
The heap is managed manually by the developer explicitly allocating and freeing memory. 

**Stack**
The stack is managed automatically as function calls are made and terminated. 

**Benefits and Drawbacks**
Although this leaves the possibility of memory leaks or dangling pointers and requires more attention to detail, it offers very high performance.
